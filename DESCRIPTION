Description: The arrangement of hypotheses in a hierarchical structure appears 
    in many research fields and often indicates different resolutions at which 
    data can be viewed. On which resolution level should the signal be 
    intepreted has arisen researchers' interest. A flexible method to select 
    resolution level, instead of cutting the tree structure at arbitary levels,
    is desired. Our package treeclimbR is such a tool that using a tuning 
    parameter to generate candidate resolutions and further select the best 
    resolution level.
